** Browser pass extension problems
I've had issues getting browserpass to work on some of my recent installs. Solved via this link [[https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension/issues/158][github-fix]].

Specifically this comment (may need modification depending on the browser in use):
#+begin_src sh
sudo mkdir -p /etc/opt/chrome/native-messaging-hosts/
sudo ln -s /etc/chromium/native-messaging-hosts/com.github.browserpass.native.json  /etc/opt/chrome/native-messaging-hosts/com.github.browserpass.native.json
#+end_src
